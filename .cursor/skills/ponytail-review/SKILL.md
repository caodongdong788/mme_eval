description: >
  Code review focused exclusively on over-engineering. Finds what to delete:
  reinvented standard library, unneeded dependencies, speculative abstractions,
  dead flexibility. One line per finding: location, what to cut, what replaces
  it. Use when the user says "review for over-engineering", "what can we
  delete", "is this over-engineered", "simplify review", or invokes
  /ponytail-review. Complements correctness-focused review, this one only
  hunts complexity.

Review diffs for unnecessary complexity. One line per finding: location, what
to cut, what replaces it. The diff's best outcome is getting shorter.

## Format

`L<line>: <tag> <what>. <replacement>.`, or `<file>:L<line>: ...` for
multi-file diffs.

Tags:

- `delete:` dead code, unused flexibility, speculative feature. Replacement: nothing.
- `stdlib:` hand-rolled thing the standard library ships. Name the function.
- `native:` dependency or code doing what the platform already does. Name the feature.
- `yagni:` abstraction with one implementation, config nobody sets, layer with one caller.
- `shrink:` same logic, fewer lines. Show the shorter form.

## Examples

❌ "This EmailValidator class might be more complex than necessary, have you
considered whether all these validation rules are needed at this stage?"

✅ `L12-38: stdlib: 27-line validator class. "@" in email, 1 line, real validation is the confirmation mail.`

✅ `L4: native: moment.js imported for one format call. Intl.DateTimeFormat, 0 deps.`

✅ `repo.py:L88: yagni: AbstractRepository with one implementation. Inline it until a second one exists.`

✅ `L52-71: delete: retry wrapper around an idempotent local call. Nothing replaces it.`

✅ `L30-44: shrink: manual loop builds dict. dict(zip(keys, values)), 1 line.`

## Scoring

End with the only metric that matters: `net: -<N> lines possible.`

If there is nothing to cut, say `Lean already. Ship.` and stop.

## Boundaries

Complexity only, correctness bugs, security holes, and performance go to a
normal review pass, not this one. A single smoke test or `assert`-based
self-check is the ponytail minimum, not bloat, never flag it for deletion.
Does not apply the fixes, only lists them.
"stop ponytail-review" or "normal mode": revert to verbose review style.

## Invocation（MME 仓库 · 强制）

**本仓库变更类任务**：ponytail-review MUST 由**写代码之外的子 Agent** 执行，禁止实现 Agent 自审。

1. 父 Agent 在编码 + 测试/门禁通过后、`git commit` 前，用 `Task` 新起子 Agent：`readonly: true`，**不得** `resume` 写代码用的同一子 Agent。
2. 子 Agent prompt 模板：

```
Read .cursor/skills/ponytail-review/SKILL.md and follow it exactly.
Review ONLY this diff for over-engineering. Do not modify files.
Output: one line per finding + final line `net: -N lines possible.` or `Lean already. Ship.`

<paste git diff && git diff --cached>
```

3. 父 Agent 根据 findings 决定是否返工；不得自行复述 findings 冒充已审查。
